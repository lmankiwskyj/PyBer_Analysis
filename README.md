As you can see in the graph above and data frame below, while the average fare per ride is higher in rural and suburban areas, the greatest volume of rides is in urban areas.

The box and whisker plots below nicely display the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum ranges of the ride counts, fares, and number of drivers by city type.

The pie charts above and below clearly show the distribution percentage of fares, total rides, and total drivers by city type. The largest piece of the pie is clearly in urban areas.

### ***By City Type and Date Range***
Reviewing the total average weekly fares for each city type (as shown below), all city types have a high peak in average fairs during the third week of February.

## Summary
Suggestions to address disparities among the city types:
* Increase number of drivers in rural and suburban areas, the total number of drivers is over 50% higher than the number of rides in urban areas, compared to suburban and rural areas.
* Decrease the fares in rural and suburban areas, the average fare per ride is $10 more for rural compared to urban areas.
* Review additional data to figure out why the average fare per driver is so much higher in rural areas.
